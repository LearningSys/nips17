# Call for Papers - ML Systems Workshop @ NIPS 2017
We invite participation in the ML Systems Workshop which will be held in conjunction with NIPS 2017 on December 8, 2017 in Long Beach, California.

## Overview
 
The goal of this workshop is to bring together experts working at the crossroads of ML, system design and software engineering to explore the challenges faced when building practical large-scale machine learning systems. In particular, we aim to elicit new connections among these diverse fields, identify tools, best practices and design principles. The workshop will cover ML and AI platforms and algorithm toolkits (Caffe 2.0, Tensor Flow, Torch etc), as well as dive into Machine learning focused developments in distributed learning platforms, programming languages, data structures and general purpose GPU programming.
 
We welcome high quality papers summarizing work in the broad area of large scale systems and software design for machine learning.   A few (non-exhaustive) topics of interest include
* Systems for training and serving machine learning models at scale
* Systems for online and batch learning algorithms
* Systems for out-of-core machine learning
* Systems for scalable deep learning
* Large scale distributed learning algorithms -- challenges faced and lessons learned
* Database systems for large scale learning
* Advances in specialized hardware (GPU, FPGA, ASIC) for training and serving
* Programming languages for machine learning
* Machine learning system design -- learning for job scheduling, configuration tuning, straggler mitigation, network configuration, security, and other systems challenges
* Interactive machine learning systems
* Benchmarking systems (for machine learning algorithms)
 
Through invited talks, oral and poster presentations by the participants, this workshop will showcase the latest advances in machine learning systems and address challenges at the intersection of Machine Learning and System Design.
